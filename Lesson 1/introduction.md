## Introduction:
- Find a way to communicate: preferably messenger
- As they eat, cover what they want to do, such as focusing on the CCC (built-in Python functions, efficiency, algorithm, etc.) or on Python (such as project based work, probably for after the CCC)
- Github Student Pack: https://education.github.com/pack, make an account with your regular email, then click get the pack from the url listed above and use your VSB email to verify that you are a student
    - Your student email is {Your student ID}@learn.vsb.bc.ca and password is most likely 'student', but you may have to check with the office
- Environment: use a better environment than the default Python environment
    - In terms of text editors (easier editing), use Sublime or Atom (just search them up)
    - In terms of IDE's, I recommend Pycharm (Pro is free if you have Github Student) but Spyder is okay too 
- Make a folder of all your Python files for practicing for the CCC and use one file for each problem
